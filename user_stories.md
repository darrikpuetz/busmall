<p>As a partner of BusMall, I want to create an application that users can judge certain products.
As a user, I want to have a problem free interface that lets me quickly scroll through the items so I do not become frustrated with the application.
As a developer I want to create a application that displays items at random for users to judge and give them feedback. 
As a developer, I need to have a way to search through an array that than deletes the previous photos from the array so users arent shown repeated items.</p>
